# LLM Collective @Penn

## Mission Statement
**LLM Collective @Penn**  
We are an open-source ecosystem at Penn dedicated to fostering shared learning and exploration of generative AI. Our community is intentionally interdisciplinary, bringing together clinicians, developers, researchers, scientists, and trainees to advance the frontiers of generative AI in medicine.

Our mission is to:  
- **Collaborate Across Disciplines**: Create opportunities to connect and work together, sharing expertise to develop innovative solutions in medicine and beyond.  
- **Share Resources and Knowledge**: Minimize duplication of effort by pooling tools, workflows, and insights, enabling members to focus on what’s next.  
- **Present and Refine Ideas**: Offer a platform for members to share their work, receive feedback, and troubleshoot challenges in a supportive environment.  
- **Develop Practical Applications**: Design and build applications, workflows, and tools that bring the power of generative AI into real-world medical and research contexts.  

As generative AI continues to grow, the **LLM Collective @Penn** is a space to stay ahead of the curve, work collaboratively, and drive impactful innovation.
